    Extra FE - D1 LinkedIn Part 1

    You'll be implementing the frontend of a LinkedIn-like application.
    Today you are gonna focus on the "profile page".
    Make it as close as possible as LinkedIn
    
    https://www.linkedin.com/in/me/

    NOTE:
    Every user has a unique username and password.
    Every request to the API should use Basic Authentication to secure access to the LinkedIn contents.

    Authentication: Basic base64(username:password)

    API:

    - GET https://striveschool.herokuapp.com/api/profiles/me

    - GET https://striveschool.herokuapp.com/api/profiles/{username}
    Retrieves the profile with username = {username}
    - POST https://striveschool.herokuapp.com/api/profiles/
    Create the user profile with all his details
    - PUT https://striveschool.herokuapp.com/api/profiles/
    Update current user profile details
