    Extra FE - D2 LinkedIn Part 2

    You'll be implementing the frontend of a LinkedIn-like application.
    Today you are gonna focus on the "experiences" in the profile page you started yesterday.
    Make it as close as possible as LinkedIn
    
    https://www.linkedin.com/in/me/

    NOTE:
    Every user has a unique username and password.
    Every request to the API should use Basic Authentication to secure access to the LinkedIn contents.

    Authentication: Basic base64(username:password)

    API:

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    EXPERIENCES:

    - POST https://striveschool.herokuapp.com/api/profiles/userName/experiences
    Create an experience. NOTE: every user is allowed to mess only with his own experiences
